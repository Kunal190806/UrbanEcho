# UrbanEcho: Smart City Navigator

## Mission Statement

UrbanEcho not only remembers where you’ve been — it helps you travel smarter, live cleaner, and save energy for a sustainable urban future.

We envision a future where cities are not just smart, but wise. A future where every citizen’s daily actions — from choosing an EV over a fossil-fuel vehicle, to switching off a light, to picking a sustainable route — are connected, measured, and amplified. UrbanEcho is the platform that makes this possible, turning millions of individual choices into a powerful, collective force for environmental transformation. We are building more than an app; we are building a community of citizens actively co-creating the sustainable cities of tomorrow.

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.
